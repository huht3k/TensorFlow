  Tutorial for Tensorflow

  Modified the python files from http://tensorflow.org to ipynb files


## TensorFlow/cifar10
CIFAR-10 is a common benchmark in machine learning for image recognition.

http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Code in this directory demonstrates how to use TensorFlow to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN).
Deep layers and structures are both important.

### cifar10_35.ipynb
Demostrate a base model, the test accuracy is about 35%

### cifar10_one_layer.ipynb
Demonstrate svm and softmax classifier with tensorflow, the test accuracy is about 35%

### cifar10_two_layer.ipynb
Demonstrate two-layer full connnected net with tensorflow, the test accuracy is about 50%
